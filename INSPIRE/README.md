# Overview of work pertaining to INSPIRE

For compliance with INSPIRE, data providers must demonstrate complaince with the INSPIRE Implementing Rules. 
Pertaining to the data requirements towards download services, we have shown alignment between STA V1.1 and 
both INSPIRE Environmental Monitoring Facilities and the Observational model in our publication on ["Extending INSPIRE to the Internet of Things through
SensorThings API" doi:10.3390/geosciences8060221](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/8/6/221)

## Data Alignment - Matching tables

The Excel Sheet [INSPIRE SensorThings Matching](https://github.com/DataCoveEU/SensorThings/blob/master/INSPIRE/INSPIRE%20SensorThings%20Matching.xlsx) provides a good basis for the alignment of an existing data source with the requirements from STA and INSPIRE

## Network Services Alignment

In order to qualify STA as an INSPIRE Download Service, the requirements laid down in the Implementing Rules for Network Services (IR NS) must be fulfilled. To simplify this task, a Google Sheet has been created detailing the IR requirements together with STA implementation options. Should IR requirements be identified that cannot be supported by STA 1.0, proposals for extension in STA 1.1 should be provided.

The IR NS Requirements as pertains to STA are available at [INSPIRE IR NS - STA](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zX4znRUhsSeZhNMKMLsg3kFbec7hdhrOwujaFHkwl78/edit#gid=0), please request edit rights
